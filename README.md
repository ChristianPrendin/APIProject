# Algorithmic Efficiency Project

## Overview

This project is a culmination of my studies in 'Algoritmi E Principi Dell'Informatica' (Algorithms and Principles of Computer Science) during my bachelor's degree. It was a core component, contributing significantly to my final academic evaluation. The primary focus of this project was to design and implement efficient algorithms and data structures, demonstrating a strong understanding of computational performance.

**Professor**: Davide Martinenghi

## Performance Highlights

I achieved the highest possible score, a **30L/30**, by rigorously optimizing for both memory usage and execution time. This table summarizes the performance benchmarks:

| Score | Memory (MiB) | Time (s) | Result |
|-------------|--------------|----------|:------------------:|
| 18 | 128 | 19 | :white_check_mark: |
| 21 | 118 | 15 | :white_check_mark: |
| 24 | 108 | 10 | :white_check_mark: |
| 27 | 98 | 6 | :white_check_mark: |
| 30 | 88 | 4 | :white_check_mark: |
| **30L** | **78** | **1** | :white_check_mark: |

## Tools & Technologies

This project was developed using a standard set of robust tools:

| Category | Tool |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| IDE | [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |
| Compiler | [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) |
| Memory Profiling | [Valgrind - Massif](https://valgrind.org/) |
| Operating System | MacOS |

## Experience It Yourself!

Curious to see the project specifications and my approach? You can explore the full details:

*   **Specification**: Understand the problem statement and requirements in the [specification document](Descrizione_prova_finale.pdf).

To replicate the 30L/30 score, your solution for test case [111](archivio_test_aperti/open_111.txt) must execute in under **1 second** and utilize less than **78 MB** of memory.

## How to Run Tests

Follow these simple steps to compile and test your code against the provided test cases (example uses `test_1.txt`):

1.  **Compile**: `make your_c_file` (replace `your_c_file` with your actual C file name).
2.  **Execute**: `./your_c_file > output.txt < Tests/test_1.txt`
3.  **Verify**: Compare your generated `output.txt` with the expected output in `Tests/test_1.output.txt` to check for correctness.
